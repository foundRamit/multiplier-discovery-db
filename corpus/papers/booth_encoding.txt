Title: A Signed Binary Multiplication Technique (1951)Author: Andrew D. BoothKey Concept: Booth Encoding (specifically Radix-4) looks at three bits of the multiplier at a time to decide whether to add, subtract, or skip a shifted version of the multiplicand.Trade-off: Cuts the number of partial products in half. Requires more complex "Booth Encoder" logic but significantly reduces the number of addition stages.Complexity: Reduces partial products to $N/2$.
