Title: Computer Arithmetic: Algorithms and Hardware DesignsAuthor: Behrooz ParhamiKey Concept: Ripple Carry Array Multipliers use a regular grid of Full Adders. Each partial product is added to the previous sum in a row-by-row fashion.Trade-off: Very easy to layout (regular structure) but slow because the carry signal must ripple through $N$ rows and $M$ columns.Complexity: Area $O(N^2)$, Delay $O(N)$.
