Title: Some Schemes for Parallel Multipliers (1965)Author: Luigi DaddaKey Concept: Similar to Wallace, but Dadda optimizes for the minimum number of gates by only performing reductions at specific levels (the "Bucklin" sequence).Trade-off: Generally uses fewer gates than a Wallace tree but might have a slightly longer critical path depending on the final adder used.Complexity: Delay $O(\log N)$.
