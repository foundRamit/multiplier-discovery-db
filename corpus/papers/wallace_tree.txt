Title: A Suggestion for a Fast Multiplier (1964)Author: C. S. WallaceKey Concept: Uses a tree of Carry-Save Adders (CSAs) to reduce the partial products to two final numbers (sum and carry vectors) as quickly as possible.Trade-off: Extremely fast. However, the wiring is irregular and "messy," making it harder to design the physical layout compared to array multipliers.Complexity: Delay is logarithmic $O(\log N)$.
